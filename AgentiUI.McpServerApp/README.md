# MCP Server

## AgenticUI integration

`get_random_number` takes **no arguments** and returns one server-generated integer
from **0 through 1000 inclusive**. BackendTools displays the returned number in a
dedicated result card alongside its existing weather card.

Aspire launches this project with `Mcp__Transport=http`, manages its HTTPS endpoint,
and connects Web using service discovery. HTTP mode serves Streamable HTTP MCP at
`/mcp` and includes ServiceDefaults health checks/telemetry.

To run HTTP mode manually:

```powershell
dotnet run --project AgentiUI.McpServerApp -- --Mcp:Transport=http --urls=http://localhost:5055
```

Set `Mcp__Endpoint=http://localhost:5055/mcp` in the Web process for manual hosting.
The HTTP endpoint is intended for local development, not unauthenticated public hosting.
The default transport is still **stdio**; the IDE and NuGet configurations below
continue to work without HTTP arguments. HTTP mode requires ASP.NET Core runtime
assets, which are included in self-contained publishing.

This README was created using the C# MCP server project template.
It demonstrates how you can easily create an MCP server using C# and publish it as a NuGet package.

The MCP server is built as a self-contained application and does not require the .NET runtime to be installed on the target machine.
However, since it is self-contained, it must be built for each target platform separately.
By default, the template is configured to build for:
* `win-x64`
* `win-arm64`
* `osx-arm64`
* `linux-x64`
* `linux-arm64`
* `linux-musl-x64`

If your users require more platforms to be supported, update the list of runtime identifiers in the project's `<RuntimeIdentifiers />` element.

See [aka.ms/nuget/mcp/guide](https://aka.ms/nuget/mcp/guide) for the full guide.

## Checklist before publishing to NuGet.org

- Test the MCP server locally using the steps below.
- Update the package metadata in the .csproj file, in particular the `<PackageId>`.
- Update `.mcp/server.json` to declare your MCP server's inputs.
  - See [configuring inputs](https://aka.ms/nuget/mcp/guide/configuring-inputs) for more details.
- Pack the project using `dotnet pack`.

The `bin/Release` directory will contain the package file (.nupkg), which can be [published to NuGet.org](https://learn.microsoft.com/nuget/nuget-org/publish-a-package).

## Developing locally

To test this MCP server from source code (locally) without using a built MCP server package, you can configure your IDE to run the project directly using `dotnet run`.

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "AgentiUI.McpServerApp": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "dotnet",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "--project",
        "<PATH TO PROJECT DIRECTORY>"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Refer to the VS Code or Visual Studio documentation for more information on configuring and using MCP servers:

- [Use MCP servers in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/mcp-servers)
- [Use MCP servers in Visual Studio](https://learn.microsoft.com/visualstudio/ide/mcp-servers)

## Testing the MCP Server

Once configured, ask Copilot Chat `Generate a random number`. It should use
`get_random_number` on `AgentiUI.McpServerApp` and return an integer in the inclusive
range 0-1000. For multiple numbers, the tool is called once per number.

## Publishing to NuGet.org

1. Run `dotnet pack -c Release` to create the NuGet package
2. Publish to NuGet.org with `dotnet nuget push bin/Release/*.nupkg --api-key <your-api-key> --source https://api.nuget.org/v3/index.json`

## Using the MCP Server from NuGet.org

Once the MCP server package is published to NuGet.org, you can configure it in your preferred IDE. Both VS Code and Visual Studio use the `dnx` command to download and install the MCP server package from NuGet.org.

- **VS Code**: Create a `<WORKSPACE DIRECTORY>/.vscode/mcp.json` file
- **Visual Studio**: Create a `<SOLUTION DIRECTORY>\.mcp.json` file

For both VS Code and Visual Studio, the configuration file uses the following server definition:

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "AgentiUI.McpServerApp": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "dnx",
      "args": [
        "<your package ID here>",
        "--version",
        "<your package version here>",
        "--yes"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```
